# Schedule My Day

## Purpose
With this challenge I wanted to create a day-scheduler that would allow a user to plan out their day during normal business hours. Each hour has a text area in which events can be typed and then saved with the button to the right. When the page is refreshed, the events that have been saved will continue to display. A user can edit and save events as well. If the event is in the past, it will display with a grey background. If the event is in the future, the background will display green. And finally, if the event hour corresponds to the current hour of the day, the background will display red.
